        <p>My hobbies include,
      but not limited to, TV and Movies
      (mostly science fiction), video games,
      and assorts crafts and games. Lately I haave been playing
      the games from the <em>Fallout</em> series of games
      The first one ever played was <em>Fallout 4</em>
      on the <strong>PS4</strong> in 2016. Recently, after the
      annoucement of <em>Fallout 76</em>, I purchased <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em> Fallout New Vegas</em>
      for the <strong>PS3</strong>. I have managed to play through <em>Fallout 3</em> already,
      and I am currently playing through <em>Fallout New Vegas</em>.
      Suprisingly for games that are 10 adn 8 years old,
      they have held up over time very well.
      I have also been playing <em>Fallout Shelter</em> on my phone.</p>
      <p>My favorite TV show at this time is <em>The Expanse</em>; I was extremely relieved when <strong>Amazon</strong>
      saved the show after <strong>SyFy</strong> canceled it after 3 seasons.
      I have also been listening to the audio books
      the show is based on as well. My movie preferences include Science Fiction and Comic Book Movies.
      There haven't been any Science Fiction movies that have really wowed me latedly,
      but Comic Book Movies lately though having been going above and beyond in most cases.
      I think that is enough about me for now, looking foreward to learning more about web development.</p>
